Video games, 3D models, music you name it; I do all of them.
I'm Mercury, a game dev and a 3D modeler, also I sometimes produce music.
My goal is to become one of the youngest successful game developer and content creator.
I need your financial support to be able to reach my goal.
Thank you in advance,
